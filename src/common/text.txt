	The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.



The options are as follows:

     -b      Number the non-blank output lines, starting at 1.

     -e      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display
             a dollar sign (`$') at the end of each line.

     -n      Number the output lines, starting at 1.

     -s      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be
             single spaced.

     -t      Display non-printing characters (see the -v option), and display
             tab characters as `^I'.

     -u      Disable output buffering.

     -v      Display non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control
             characters print as `^X' for control-X; the delete character
             (octal 0177) prints as `^?'.  Non-ASCII characters (with the high
             bit set) are printed as `M-' (for meta) followed by the character
             for the low 7 bits.
